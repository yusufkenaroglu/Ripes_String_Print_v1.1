V1.1 only supports upper case English alphabet letters (ASCII 65-90). 

A maximum of 13 characters can be printed onto the matrix ("WELCOMEBAAACK")

</p>
On the left side of Ripes, the vertical grey bar contains different tabs. These tabs, when selected, are highlighted with a light shade of grey. The editor tab is where the program loaded into Ripes is displayed. The editor and processor tabs also house the console which allows the user to input data and receive output.

To be able to run the program, you will need to set up the output device. Afraid not! This section will guide you step by step.

[1]: Locate the I/O tab on the left side of Ripes. The button that takes you to the tab looks like this (See image below)

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Executing the program

You will be modifying a string stored at a label to print it onto the LED matrix display. Ways to modify said string and disclaimers will be explained further.

Before executing the program, head back to the I/O tab if you have navigated away from it. Locate the pop-out button for the LED matrix you had previously instantiated in step 2Ô∏è‚É£. Clicking once on the pop-out button pops out the LED matrix from its window and allows you to have it floating on top of Ripes so long as you have it open. (See image below)

</p>

Now, you can go back to the editor tab which contains instructions for the assembly program. Go ahead and run the program by clicking on the >> button. (See image below for green highlight)

</p>

Without changes to the original program, you should see "WELCOME" get printed on the display letter by letter. The program (for V1.1) stops execution once all letters are printed.
